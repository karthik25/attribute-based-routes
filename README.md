# Attribute Based Routes List

This package adds the ability to look at all the asp.net mvc 5 attribute based routes applied throughout your application. After installing the 
package just run your asp.net mvc 5 application, and visit "attribute-based-routes". That is, if your application is running at port 1234, you 
would have to visit http://localhost:1234/attribute-based-routes.
